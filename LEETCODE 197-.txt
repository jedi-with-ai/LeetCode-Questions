SELF-JOIN Concept

Only use it when:
data is recursive
hierarchy
1time sequence
comparison within table
When one row related in some way to another row 
w1.recordDate = w2.recordDate + 1 (w1 is today and w2 is yesterday)
e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id (to find manager and employee like hierarchy)
t1.order_id < t2.order_id (Sequence)
score1.value = MAX(score2.value) (Minimum/Maximum)

DATEADD(interval, amount, date_column) 1 to add , -1 to remove a day 


/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
SELECT w1.id FROM Weather w1
LEFT JOIN Weather w2 on w1.recordDate = DATEADD(day,1,w2.recordDate)
WHERE w1.temperature > w2.temperature;

w1 = records from second row that is today
w2 - records from first row that is yesterday 
 

SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather w1, Weather w2
WHERE DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1 AND w1.temperature > w2.temperature;

NICE CONCEPT - DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate)
