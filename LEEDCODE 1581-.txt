LEEDCODE 1581 

Initial Thinking process I left join both Visits and Transactions table 
And we group by Customer_id which will help us aggregate the count 
Since we did left join the transaction_id for the visits with no match will be NULL 
We can count these NULL values to find the time of visits where no transaction were made. 


This feels logical, but in SQL:
COUNT(column) ignores NULLs
So COUNT(t.transaction_id) will always return 0 in your filtered result.
Because when we use 
WHERE t.transaction_id IS NULL

We filtered t.transaction_id is NULL so there are only values with NULL in them and we got 0 in result. Since SQL doesn't count NULL values. 
So it would be better to count rows or even any Non-Null column since we have already filtered NULL values and grouped by. So counting any row would be fine 

/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
SELECT v.customer_id, COUNT(*) as count_no_trans FROM Visits v 
LEFT JOIN Transactions T ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id
WHERE t.transaction_id IS NULL
GROUP BY v.customer_id;
